## Short Description
*Machine Learning Assignment 1* is done completely using *Jupiter Notebook*. This Assignment mainly focuses on the python lists, tuples, dictionary, sets and a machine learning algorithm *K-Nearest Neighbor*. We can create lists using square brackets[], tuples using paranthesis(), dictionaries and sets using curly brackets{}. In dictionaries items are stored as key - value pairs. There are many predefined functions in Python to access and modify lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets. In this assignment we used some geometric formulas to calculate area of circle and its circumference.

To implement *K-Nearest Neighbor* on the given graph, we imported few functions from the sklearn package. sklearn package consists many Machine Learning Algorithms in it. Functions like *train_test_split()* to split data into training and testing sets and *KNeighborsClassifier()* to implement KNN on datasets. We also used some other functions like *Confusion_matrix()* to check the accuracy of the KNN algorithm.
